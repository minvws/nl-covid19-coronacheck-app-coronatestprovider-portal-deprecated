# CoronaCheck - Test Suite for data providers

This repository has been consolidated into (the provider documentation repository)[https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-provider-docs].

Although the code can still be found here, this repository is now readonly and future updates will only be done in the new location.

This legacy repository is scheduled for removal on July 1st, 2021.
